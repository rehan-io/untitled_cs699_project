## 📖 Overview

**Energy Access Dynamics Simulator** is a data-driven policy sandbox designed to help researchers, policymakers, and NGOs navigate the complex transition from traditional fuels to modern electricity in developing regions. 

Nearly 1 billion people lack reliable electricity, and the poorest 80% of households are consistently the last to be reached. Governments face a critical dilemma: Should they extend the national grid, subsidize off-grid Solar Home Systems (SHS), or invest in community mini-grids? 

This project answers these "what-if" questions by combining **real-world public data**, **system dynamics modeling**, and an **interactive, beautiful geospatial dashboard** to simulate the long-term cascading effects of energy policies.

---

## 🎯 Motivation & Problem Statement

- **The Reality:** Rural households climb an "energy ladder"—starting with kerosene/diesel, moving to solar lanterns, then Solar Home Systems, then mini-grids, and finally the national grid. 
- **The Challenge:** Each step involves trade-offs between cost, reliability, and infrastructure availability. The poorest households are often left behind because grid extension is expensive and upfront costs for solar are too high.
- **The Gap:** There is a lack of open-source, transparent tools that allow stakeholders to simulate how subsidies, carbon taxes, and infrastructure speeds affect the bottom 80% over a 20–30 year horizon.
- **Our Solution:** A dynamic simulation engine paired with a modern, interactive dashboard that visualizes both temporal trends and spatial infrastructure layouts.

## 📊 Public Data Sources

The simulator automatically ingests and calibrates itself using:

- **World Bank / ESMAP** – Country-wise electrification rates and access indicators.
- **IEA Energy Access Database** – Historical energy transition trends and adoption curves.
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** – Existing grid lines, off-grid infrastructure, and mini-grid locations.
- **National Energy Ministry Portals** – Country-specific pricing, tariff structures, and subsidy data.

## ⚙️ Core System Dynamics (The Simulation Engine)

The mathematical heart of the project is a **Stock & Flow** model updated annually.

### 1. The "Stocks" (Household Categories)
- **Stock A:** Traditional Fuels (Kerosene, Diesel, Biomass)
- **Stock B:** Solar Lanterns (Basic lighting & phone charging)
- **Stock C:** Solar Home Systems (SHS – Panels + Battery for appliances)
- **Stock D:** Mini-Grids (Community-level local power networks)
- **Stock E:** National Grid (Full, unlimited utility-scale electricity)

### 2. The "Flows" (Adoption Rates)
Households move from lower stocks to higher stocks based on 4 key drivers:
- **Price** (Upfront & operational costs)
- **Subsidies** (Government financial support)
- **Reliability** (Uptime and maintenance)
- **Awareness** (Social diffusion & marketing)

### 3. The Feedback Loops
The simulation incorporates a positive feedback loop (learning curve):  
*More adoption → Increased manufacturing scale → Lower unit costs → Even faster adoption.*  
This ensures the model captures realistic market acceleration.

### 4. User Controls (The Policy Levers)
Users can adjust 4 primary dials via the dashboard:
- **Subsidy Percentage** – Reduces upfront capital costs.
- **Carbon Tax** – Raises the price of traditional fuels to incentivize switching.
- **Off-Grid Deployment Rate** – Speed at which solar companies reach rural areas.
- **Grid Extension Speed** – Annual rate at which the national power company builds new lines.

## ✨ Project USP (Unique Selling Points) - Baseline Features

### ✅ 1. Multi-Tier "Energy Ladder" Modeling
Instead of a binary "electrified/not electrified" flag, the model tracks the gradual, realistic transition across 5 distinct energy tiers.

### ✅ 2. Endogenous Feedback Loops
The simulation dynamically reduces Solar Home System costs based on cumulative adoption, mimicking real-world manufacturing learning curves.

### ✅ 3. Real-Time Interactive Policy Levers
Users can move sliders for subsidies, taxes, and deployment speeds on the dashboard and instantly see the projected results update.

### ✅ 4. Automated Data Calibration
Bash/Python scripts automatically pull the latest World Bank data to calibrate the model's "Year 0" to match a selected country's current reality.

### ✅ 5. Immersive Geospatial Map Visualization
Instead of just spreadsheets, the dashboard features an interactive map (Mapbox GL JS) overlaying:
- Existing grid infrastructure.
- Mini-grid locations.
- Heatmaps showing where the bottom 80% are projected to gain access over time.

### ✅ 6. Comparative Scenario Dashboard
Users can run multiple scenarios side-by-side (e.g., "High Subsidy" vs. "Fast Grid") and toggle between them. A time-slider (2026–2050) animates the charts and maps year-by-year.

### ✅ 7. Native Scenario Isolation via Git Branching
Every policy experiment automatically creates a dedicated Git branch (e.g., `scenario-subsidy-high`), allowing users to switch between saved policy states without losing prior results.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend (Dashboard)** | **React.js** (TypeScript) + **Vite** for blazing-fast builds; **Material-UI (MUI)** for beautiful, responsive UI components; **Apache ECharts** for interactive, animated charts; **Mapbox GL JS** for high-performance geospatial rendering. |
| **Backend (API)** | **FastAPI** (Python) to serve RESTful endpoints, handle simulation requests, and return JSON results with automatic Swagger documentation. |
| **Simulation Engine** | **Python 3.10+** with **Pandas**, **NumPy** (for difference equations), and **SciPy** (for calibration curve-fitting). |
| **Geospatial Processing** | **GeoPandas** & **Shapely** to convert OSM infrastructure data into GeoJSON for the frontend map. |
| **Data Orchestration** | **Bash** scripts to glue the pipeline (`fetch_energy_data.sh`, `calibrate_model.sh`, `run_scenarios.sh`). |
| **Caching (Stretch)** | **Redis** to cache simulation results for instant slider feedback. |
| **Version Control** | **Git** with pre-commit hooks using `shellcheck` (Bash), `black`/`flake8` (Python), and `ESLint`/`Prettier` (React/TS). |

## 🔄 How It Works (User Journey)

1. **Ingest:** The system runs `fetch_energy_data.sh` to pull the latest World Bank, IEA, and OSM data.
2. **Calibrate:** `calibrate_model.sh` uses a Python script to fit the initial stocks to the real-world baseline of the selected country.
3. **Configure:** The user opens the React dashboard and adjusts the 4 policy levers using intuitive sliders.
4. **Simulate:** The frontend sends a POST request to the FastAPI backend. The backend runs the system dynamics difference equations for the next 25 years.
5. **Visualize:** The backend returns time-series data and GeoJSON map layers. The frontend:
   - Animates the stacked area charts to show households moving up the ladder.
   - Updates the Mapbox heatmaps to show geographical electrification spread.
6. **Compare:** The user can create a new Git branch to save this scenario and run an alternative policy, comparing both side-by-side on the dashboard.

## 🚀 Future Scope & Stretch Goals

- **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM):** Introduce heterogeneous household characteristics (wealth, location, family size) to refine adoption predictions.
- **Real-time Weather Integration:** Hook in solar irradiance data to model the reliability of Solar Home Systems under different climate conditions.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis Module:** Automatically compute the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for each policy mix.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Optimize the dashboard for tablet usage during field surveys.
